I’ve always loved what PageRank promised from the early days of Google: links as votes, authority that anyone could earn if readers found an idea useful enough to link to it. In that early blog era, the community was built by people actively engaging with each others’ content on their own websites. As your friends and acquaintances posted their own reactions to your post it opened the door to a world of strangers, and sometimes opportunities, as it spread. And Google's PageRank would recognize that, and reward you accordingly with higher and higher SERP rankings that drove even more traffic. ofncourse, then came the spammers, the seo keyword stuffers, etc. The incentives that were in place drove an over-influencerization of the online culture.

well times are changing, and those days are long over, and those same measuresnof "value" don’t matter much now. Google’s AI Overviews (and chatgpt, and copilot) answer the query on the results page; [when that blue panel appears](https://www.semrush.com/blog/zero-click-searches/), users often get the information they need without clicking through to the source website where the information was sourced from in the first place. Since the rollout of these AI experiences, only 25.6% of desktop searches and 17.3% of mobile searches result in zero-clicks with that trend rising. While AI-generated summaries and SERP features like knowledge panels boost visibility, they also siphon off direct traffic. The crawler still eats our words, but the traffic it once traded back is drying up. The original "promise" if there ever was one, is now broken.

With the advent of and in response to AI, many site owners bolt on “talk-to-my-site” chatbots [using RAG](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview) in an attempt to evolve with the times, and pay GPU fees to re-package their own posts. There are absolutely places where this is still viable and relevant, particularly in niches where facts mutate very often, or where you can offer a much more in-depth analysis of the content such as the work going on at [Emergent Mind](https://www.emergentmind.com/); more often though, it just repeats an answer Google or Copilot could already give anyways. Looking at emerging tools and protocols like **MCP** and **NLWeb**, which are pushing the expensive inference back to the search engine or caller, it's an indication of where things are going, and that sites and publishers need to start focusing on things AI _can't_ provide — in fact, I started looking at NLWeb in [this post](/2025/7/nlweb/), and so my own thoughts are evolving such that smarter play is to invest where the AI crawlers can’t compete.

If pure knowledge is becoming nearly free on the results page and in chat boxes standing in front of AI models ... something that is acutely felt by publishers like journalism in particular; the "value proposition" will necessarily need to shift to what happens after the click, instead of continuing to retreat behind pay walls. this will, of course, be entirely dependent on what you offer and what your audience is interested in. for example, if you're into manufacturing, maybe you offer things like running a live G-code simulator instead of describing what the g-code does when talking about CNC machines and 3D Printing; Helping the user export a bill of materials tied to a build. Or even if you are an influencer instead of just pictures, videos, and words to convince, ever increasing sophistication and integrations like booking the itinerary you’ve outlined right on your site. Start shifting your thinking to offering an interactive experience, buying an actual product or service. Tools, data, transactions, communities — things an AI summary can’t hand back in two sentences.

So yes, by yesterday’s measures this post is probably worthless. It probably won’t rank, probably won't get shared on social media, probably won’t tee up consulting gigs. In this particular case, I'm doing it _for me_. Writing it shakes the rust off my own ideas, just like it did at the start of my career, when blogging wasn’t a growth hack but a way to think in public. If a handful of readers make it here and leave with a clearer sense of where the Web’s value is drifting, that’s more than enough; icing on the cake. The real worth will live in whatever I choose to **build** next.
