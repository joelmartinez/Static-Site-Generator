Title: Social Media Diet

This has been a long time coming, 
but I'd never actually gathered up the ...
courage isn't the right word ... but the 
oomph to actually do it until now. I'm going 
to limit my social media participation 
for the month of July. Aside from all
the crazy news cycles, I feel like 
social media has reduced my usage 
of other outlets such as this very blog,
and other things like art and music. 

For now I've only moved the social media apps
on my phone, from the first page, to the second 
page; and I've also blocked twitter and facebook 
via hosts file entries on my computer ... 
just to maintain discipline. 

Habits are difficult things to change.
I hope to make a bit of a change in my
habits. 

See you next month
