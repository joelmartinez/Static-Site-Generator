I had the privilege to co-present a Session at [Xamarin Evolve 2014](https://evolve.xamarin.com) with the 
incomparable [Larry O'Brien](http://www.knowing.net/).

A video of the talk should be online soon at: [https://evolve.xamarin.com](https://evolve.xamarin.com).

In the session, I presented a city rendered using SceneKit, from CSV data provided by a type provider. I've uploaded 
a modified version of this that simply uses a random function to position buildings.

One notable mention of the talk was [Eric Sink](http://ericsink.com/entries/fs_guilt.html):

> "On Friday, Larry O'Brien (*ed: and me! :)* ) gave another fantastic session on F&#35;. And I left with 
> the even stronger impression that even though learning cool functional stuff is great, I don't have 
> to be a functional pursit to benefit from F&#35;."

I'm really glad that this was at least one of the takeaways from our talk. There's plenty of intimidating content out
there from academia, and other functional programming purists. And for a long time this kept me away from really digging
in. F&#35; makes it really easy to start dipping your toes in the water ... especially when paired with 
[Xamarin Sketches](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/sketches/introduction/) :)
