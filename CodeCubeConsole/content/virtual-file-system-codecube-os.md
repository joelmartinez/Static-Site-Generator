Title: Virtual File System for CodeCube OS

I've just implemented a virtual file system for [CodeCube OS](https://codecube.net/os/) that turns the site's content linkmap into a navigable terminal experience. It's like having a Unix-style shell that lets you explore blog posts, categories, and content relationships as if they were files and directories.

## How It Works

The virtual file system builds on the existing [link map visualization](https://codecube.net/map/) data structure. When you navigate to the OS terminal, it automatically downloads and parses the linkmap JSON, then constructs a virtual directory tree:

- `/content` - All blog posts as `.md` files
- `/years` - Posts organized by publication year (2025/, 2024/, etc.)
- `/categories` - Posts grouped by category (ai/, programming/, etc.)
- `/entities` - Posts grouped by extracted entities (technologies, companies, etc.)

## Terminal Commands

The implementation includes several Unix-style commands:

**Navigation:**
- `ls` - List directory contents
- `cd <directory>` - Change to a directory  
- `pwd` - Show current directory path

**Content Access:**
- `cat <file>` - Display post metadata and description
- `open <file>` - Open the post URL in a new browser tab

**Utility:**
- `help` - Show available commands
- `clear` - Clear the terminal

## Technical Implementation

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Backend Virtual File System (C#)** - A `VirtualFileSystem` class that can parse the linkmap data and build the directory structure programmatically. This provides the foundation for representing content as a hierarchical file system.

2. **Frontend Terminal Interface (JavaScript)** - Built on the existing React-based terminal, with new commands that interact with the virtual file system. The terminal maintains state for the current working directory and provides a familiar shell experience.

The magic happens when the terminal loads - it automatically initializes the virtual file system using the same linkmap data that powers the visual content map. This means both the graphical visualization and the terminal interface are views into the same underlying content structure.

## Why Build This?

This project scratches a few different itches:

**Exploration**: Sometimes you want to browse content in a different way. The visual map is great for seeing connections, but the terminal provides a more systematic way to drill down into specific categories or time periods.

**Nostalgia**: There's something satisfying about navigating content with `ls` and `cd` commands. It brings back the feeling of exploring Unix systems, but applied to blog content.

**Technical Challenge**: Converting a graph-based data structure (nodes and edges) into a hierarchical file system is an interesting programming problem. The implementation handles multiple views of the same data - you can find the same post in `/content`, `/years/2025`, and `/categories/programming`.

## Content as Code

This approach treats content like source code that you can navigate programmatically. You can:

```bash
$ cd /categories/ai
$ ls
$ cat ai-hype.md
$ open ai-race.md
```

It's a different way to think about content management - instead of a traditional CMS interface, you get a command-line interface to your content repository.

## Next Steps

The current implementation provides read-only access to the content structure. Future enhancements could include:

- Search functionality (`find`, `grep` commands)
- Content statistics (`wc`, file size information)
- Relationship traversal (following links between posts)
- Integration with the visual map (jump from terminal path to visualization)

The virtual file system demonstrates how existing content structures can be repurposed for different interaction models. The same linkmap data now powers both a visual graph interface and a terminal-based navigation system, giving users multiple ways to explore the same content.

Try it yourself at [codecube.net/os](https://codecube.net/os/) - start with `help` to see available commands, then explore with `ls` and `cd`.
