Title: Charging Fatigue

Anyone else get tired of charging stuff? 

I do! 

These days, I have to worry about a whole menagerie of things that may or may not work when I pick
it up, based on whether I remembered to charge it:

- Laptop (Mac)
- Laptop (Windows)
- 2 HTC Vive Controllers
- Wireless Keyboard
- Wireless Touchpad
- Wireless Mouse
- Nintendo Switch (at least this one rests in its charging dock)
- Nintendo Switch Controllers (if I leave them undocked from the main unit)
- PS4 Controllers
- Phone
- iPad
- AirPods
- Apple Watch
- Over-the-ear BT headphones.
- Apple TV Remote
- Kindle
- 3 Separate portable chargers
- 4 Quadcopter LiPo batteries
- Quadcopter FPV Googles
- Quadcopter Radio
- GoPro
- 3 Airsoft NiHm batteries

And out of all these, they require different units/cables: Lightning Cables, older iPad cable, Micro-USB, 
Mini-USB, Batteries (rechargable or not), LiPo charger, NiMh charger, Mac power adapter, 
Dell power adapter, Nintendo switch charging dock *and* power adapter for when mobile. 

It's exhausting! I'm really wondering/hoping that wireless Qi charging will become prominent. It won't
be as painful if we can just passively charge these things when they're not in use. I just know that
carrying around a mass of cables and chargers is not sustainable.
