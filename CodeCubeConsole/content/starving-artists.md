It's an unfortunate truth that the more connected to someone's passion a job seems to be (artist, filmmaking, game development, musician, etc), the less financially rewarding and stable the career seems to be. Of course there are wildly successful individuals in all those roles, but the stats don't lie ... most gamedevs/musicians/artists have to do it in their spare time.

You can talk about all the market dynamics you want, but this is bad for the world despite the historic consistency of it (ever heard of the trope of the starving artist? it's a thing for a reason). What can we do to move the world a little bit more in the direction of making these professions more viable?
