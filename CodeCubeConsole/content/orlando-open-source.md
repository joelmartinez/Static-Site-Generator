In case you haven't heard, [Orlando's tech scene is Rising](http://www.floridatechnologyjournal.com/orlandorising).
Of course, the startup community is only part of the story; not only are there well established technology companies
in the area, but many professionals that work tirelessly to share technology. 
We are collecting information about Open Source projects that are developed in Orlando, and surrounding areas. 
We are interested in learning about projects at any level of participation; whether you are the sole 
maintainer, part of a distributed team, or you simply have contributed a patch or two to an existing project.

Projects can be in any technology stack, and even if the projects are a little out of date, or are 
fiercely maintained; we want to find out who the movers and shakers in open source are in Central Florida.
