Well ... it's been entirely too long, but if you're reading this I'm BACK ONLINE!
Technically, the site has never been offline, but the deployment pipeline was mistakenly 
deleted sometime in 2021. This was before I had migrated to github actions where the pipeline
definition was stored in the repository itself, so there was no getting it back and I just 
kept procrastinating. But I'm back!!!

It's been a busy three years since my last post, so I'll follow up with another post with updates
about what I've been up to, and then eventually some stuff coming up. So excited.
