Taking a moment to update here about [Microsoft Copilot for Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/copilot) (_Ask Learn_ integration). Shipped to public preview in November of 2023, at Microsoft's Ignite conference, it's an AI companion that helps you [design, operate, optimize, and troubleshoot your cloud infrastructure](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-infrastructure-blog/simplify-it-management-with-microsoft-copilot-for-azure-save/ba-p/3981106). What's exciting for me personally, is that building off the success of _Q&A Assist_ (which I talked about in [my last post](/2023/7/what-ive-been-up-to-since-2020/), and is now Generally Available on [Microsoft Q&A](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/)), our team got the chance to work with Azure to help build _Microsoft Copilot for Azure_. They worked with many partners internally to build this, and we worked with them to ensure that they were able to give grounded answers to questions, using Learn Documentation.

2023 was an absolute whirlwind, as so many folks, including me and my team, were learning how to incorporate AI into their products. There's many opportunities ahead, and I'm looking forward to exploring and experimenting.
