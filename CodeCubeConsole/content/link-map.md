I wrote [*This Post is Worthless*](https://codecube.net/2025/7/worthless-post/) about how the old web worked, back when links weren‚Äôt just SEO fuel but the actual connective tissue of the internet. If I‚Äôm going to talk about that, I figured I should put my site where my mouth is and actually build something to explore it.

So I did. The [Article Link Map](https://codecube.net/map/) is a little experiment that takes every post I‚Äôve written and drops it into a network graph. Each post connects to the year it was written and to any other post it links to. You can pan, zoom, click around, and hopefully, fall into a weird little rabbit hole of my own making.

The idea isn‚Äôt new to me. Back when I was the docs engineer for Xamarin, I had a half-built prototype of this for the documentation. We never quite shipped it because it wasn‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúcommercially useful.‚Äù This is my site, though. I don‚Äôt have to ask permission or justify the ROI üòÖ

After getting the map up and running, I decided it needed another layer: categories. My blog software didn‚Äôt even have them, _technically_ ... some of the content did behind the scenes. See, this blog software started life as a way for me to get out of Wordpress. So the initial implementation (which is still there) is actually processing the XML of all the content from Wordpress (the markdown content support came later). And so I wrote a custom category system, pushed it live, and was ready to start the long, boring job of tagging a decade-plus of posts.

Instead, I thought to myself ... hey, let Copilot do it! It went through my entire archive and added categories.

Now the map isn‚Äôt just posts and years. It‚Äôs three overlapping layers:
- Chronology (posts by year)
- Interlinking (posts referencing each other)
- Thematic clusters (AI-generated categories)

There‚Äôs something weird and a little thrilling about having AI re-examine your own writing corpus. 

Now ... why bother with something like this? Partly because it‚Äôs fun, and partly because I‚Äôm trying to experiment with what a personal site can be in 2025 and beyond. The default blog/archive model hasn‚Äôt changed much in more than two decades. Everything flows linearly, and search is a bolt-on. But what happens when you give your content a spatial dimension? What happens when exploration isn‚Äôt just scrolling backward in time, but literally moving through a graph of your ideas?

This is the first step. The next thing I‚Äôm looking at is [GraphRAG](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/graphrag/) ‚Äî using a graph as the backbone for retrieval and navigation. The map you see now is a static version of that concept. I want to see what happens when it becomes dynamic, queryable, maybe even conversational.

This doesn‚Äôt have to be useful to anyone but me for now.  But if you find yourself wandering the map and discovering something you wouldn‚Äôt have clicked otherwise, maybe that‚Äôs enough to make it *useful* after all.
