    Well that was fun :) It was only two years ago that I <a href="http://codecube.net/2010/06/moving-to-new-york/">moved to NYC</a>. In that time, I made a ton of new friends, had great conversations, and expanded my horizons by changing my focus to mobile development. It was an amazing experience, and I'm glad I had it. That being said, I am glad to be back in Orlando amongst family and friends. Working from home will be an interesting experience. I've done it before, but always under slightly different circumstances. I plan on visiting several <a href="http://urbanrethink.com/">co-working</a> <a href="http://orlando.colabusa.com/">spaces</a> from time to time ... there's been lots of <a href="http://www.floridatechnologyjournal.com/latest-video?slg=ftj-live-orlandos-tech-boom&amp;orderby=latest">exciting activity</a> going on in Orlando, so I'm looking forward to getting to know more of the tech community here.<br /><br />But, as they say, time stands still for no man; so I've already got a few events coming up that you should totally come to and participate in!
<ul>
	<li>I will be a judge for an upcoming contest being run by the <a href="http://owpug.tattoocoder.com/">Orlando Windows Phone user group</a>. The contest is to build a windows phone or windows 8 app using the <a href="https://developer.darkskyapp.com/">Dark Sky API</a>, for which I wrote an <a href="https://github.com/joelmartinez/darksky-csharp">API wrapper</a>:

	<li>August 23rd, I will be speaking at the <a href="http://onetug.org">Orlando .NET User Group</a> on writing <a href="http://twilio.com">Twilio</a> apps:

</ul>
There's a few other things in the works ... it's an amazing time to be a developer :)
