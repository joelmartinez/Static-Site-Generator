    I was implementing a feature in the <a href="http://caloriecount.about.com/">CalorieCount</a> <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.about.CalorieCount">Android App</a> the other day that was previously implemented in the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calorie-counter-by-caloriecount/id367018196?mt=8">iOS version</a> of that same app. Just needed to show a list of timezones based on what country was selected. Not rocket science at all, but the iOS implementation was storing the data in a plist file, with a &lt;dict&gt; element inside. So rather than take that data and try to translate it to something more 'android specific' ... I decided to just use the file as is. The biggest benefit was that in the future if we ever had to update the file, I could update it in place, and simply copy it over to the other platform.<br /><br />So I copied the file into my xml folder, and wrote this simple parser that reads the file in, and parses it into a HashMap<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/joelmartinez/2655811.js"></script><br /><br />The way I look at it, may as well reuse what we've got, and spend less time yak shaving (ie. translating between platforms) ... git 'er done!
