<h3 id="how-to-proceed-if-youre-a-builder">How to Proceed If You're a Builder</h3>
<p>The big players have two obvious advantages: deeper pockets for training and a nonstop stream of user data to learn from. Add the comfort buyers feel when they pick a household name, plus ever-growing SDKs and plug-ins, and the gap widens almost on autopilot.</p>
<p>Chasing a new foundation model is probably a dead end unless you own data no one else can touch. The smarter play is solving a narrow problem brilliantly or wrapping the big models in a workflow people love. Keep an eye on release notes: a shiny feature can be &quot;<a href="https://www.simplymac.com/apps/what-does-sherlocking-an-app-mean">Sherlocked</a>&quot; into a platform overnight, so have a plan B ready. And assume margins on simple wrappers will shrink as usage prices keep falling.</p>
<p>Realize that for the buyers you'll be seeking out, they're going to start with the major APIs, who are adding features that once took a small village of start-ups. When a smaller vendor pitches &quot;custom,&quot; press for specifics you can't get from wiring up an off-the-shelf SDK. Price isn't everything, though. You may still pick the niche tool for better support in your corner of the world or tighter control over your data.</p>
