    The 2010 Orlando CodeCamp has now come to an end. It was a great event, and I'm glad I was a part of it. Many congratulations go out to Esteban, Will, and the rest of the board and volunteers that put it together. With almost 600 .NET developers in attendance, it shows that the central florida area is brimming with talent.<br /><br />I've uploaded the slides to my presentation which was titled, "<em>How to Finish a Game with XNA</em>". You can download them here:
