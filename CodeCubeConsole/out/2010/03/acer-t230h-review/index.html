    I <a href="http://codecube.net/2010/02/which-multitouch-monitor-to-buy/">settled</a> on the Acer T230H multitouch monitor<br /><br /><a href="http://codecube.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Acer-T230H.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-277" title="Acer T230H" src="http://codecube.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Acer-T230H.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="254" /></a><br /><br />So far, I'm happy enough with it. When I plugged it into the USB port on my computer, windows 7 already had drivers for it so it was kind of nice that I did not have to install any extra software; Though I haven't installed the software disc that came with the monitor so I don't know if there are any extra niceties that come with it.<br /><br />The first thing that hit me was how large and nice the screen is. Definitely a great picture. Of course the first thing I did was fire up MS Paint, which natively supports multiple touch points. Single finger manipulation (I'll have to trademark that one) works really well and is quite accurate. Two fingers however seems to be pretty buggy, especially when you move the touchpoints near each other.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to programming against some of the <a href="http://codecube.net/2010/02/state-of-multitouch-with-xna/">APIs</a> that are available. In particular, I'm looking forward to experimenting with new interface models rather than the usual textboxes, buttons, tree views, and menus.
