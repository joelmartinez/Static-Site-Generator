    I've been very interested in multitouch every since I saw Johnny Lee's awesome <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0awjPUkBXOU&amp;feature=youtube_gdata">finger tracking</a> videos. Specifically, multitouch as it relates to game development. With the impending release of windows 7 tablet PCs, I have hopes that it might open up new possibilities and markets for games on the windows platform. I'm planning on picking up a <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/products/Displays/productdetail.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;cs=19&amp;sku=320-1172">Dell SX2210 monitor</a> to start playing with it.<br /><br />I sought out to find out the state of multitouch. So far, I'm not too impressed. Here are two great references to get you started:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.brianpeek.com/blog/archive/2010/01/13/multi-touch-madness-slides-and-code.aspx">Multitouch Madness</a>: Brian Peek posted the slides and source code to a presentation he gave on multitouch. I really wish I could have been there but the source code and slides are a great resource.</li>
	<li><a href="http://xna-uk.net/blogs/randomchaos/archive/2010/02/10/xna-and-windows-7-multi-touch.aspx">XNA And Windows 7 Multitouch</a>: Great article that shows how to get a touch enabled xna window rendering in windows forms.</li>
</ul>
The thing that I walked away with is that the solutions that Microsoft seems to be proposing have pretty specific dependencies on windows forms, wpf, and silverlight.Â  All things that I would rather not really deal with when I am making an XNA game. I would really prefer not to have to resort to making and managing my own window. In addition to the APIs not even really being available; Brian's slides mention that System.Windows.Input.Manipulations isn't even redistributable yet until .NET 4.0 is released.<br /><br />So I'm going to be looking into how one can take advantage of the built-in touch APIs without onerous dependencies on unreleased assemblies and hacking windows forms in the near future. Anyone have any tips on where to get started?
