    Slowly working on the site as I have time (as if).  After a lifetime of dealing with IIS, I'm not finding myself having to acquaint myself with Apache.  Particularly, I'm trying to figure out how to use mod_rewrite.  The first thing I'm trying to accomplish is to rewrite the URL for the RSS feed so that the old link will still work.  After that, I'll get the link to some of the downloads that people are looking for back up (like some of the XNA things I've written).  After that, I'm conjuring up a scheme to use the mod_rewrite stuff so that all the old links from my previous CMS work.<br /><br />Again, as I have time :-P
