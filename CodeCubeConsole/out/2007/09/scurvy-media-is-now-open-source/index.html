    So this may or may not be exciting for you faithful readers, but I've decided to release my little project out into the world as open source.<br /><br />The project is called Scurvy Media, and can be found on CodePlex:
<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ScurvyMedia">http://www.codeplex.com/ScurvyMedia</a><br /><br />Why did I call it Scurvy Media when it only contains the Video playing library?  Well, I actually have a pretty big interest in both Audio and Video media.  I would like eventually for this library to encompass a lot of the ideas I have in that field.
<h3>What's Included</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Content Pipeline assembly:
<ol>
	<li>AVI importer
Lets you import AVI videos.  the importer architecture is such that you could create importers for additional types of videos.</li>
	<li>In-memory processor
Memory will be loaded fully into memory when you load the video.</li>
	<li>Streaming processor
Video will be streamed from disk at runtime.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Runtime assembly
<ol>
	<li>Video class
very simple runtime class that has a Play method, and properties such as Loop and IsPlaying.</li>
	<li>video content manager.
If you're using the streaming processor, you have to use this custom content manager because of the way the file stream must be handled.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
I'll be talking about some of the limitations soon, which is what's driving the current development.  Hopefully this project will grow to provide lots of media related functionality to the XNA community :-)
