    <p>So everyone knows that <a href="https://damianbrady.com.au/2018/02/01/friends-dont-let-friends-right-click-publish/">friends don't let friends right-click-publish</a>.
I had previously posted about how I <a href="http://codecube.net/2017/11/sprinkling-devops/">created a continuous deployment</a> system for this blog, using VSTS,
and it had been going great. However, there was a <strong>deep (but simple) problem</strong> lurking in the pipeline that I didn't discover until last week!</p>
<p>VSTS makes it <em>really easy</em> to integrate with github, so that it builds every time a pull request is made. Awesome right?</p>
<p>Well, the issue is that in a momentary judgement lapse, I added the last step to the build process (copying files via SSH to the server);
the deployment step. So if anyone had opened a pull request, it would have automatically built the project,
and deployed that person's content to my production server, without my review. How embarrassing.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the fix was really easy ... just use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/concepts/definitions/release/what-is-release-management?view=vsts">Release Definitions</a>!</p>
<p>Once I removed the deployment task from the build definition, and created a release definition, it plugged the hole I had in my
release pipeline. Using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/concepts/definitions/release/triggers?view=vsts#release-triggers">continuous deployment trigger</a> (limited in scope to the <code>master</code> branch),
my ssh copy task can easily reach into the build artifact that resulted from the build. That way, the PR can run the build, and I can
manually inspect the build artifact to make sure it's all good, and then it automatically publishes when I merge the PR.</p>
<p>So remember that your build/release pipeline is just as important as your application's code ... so review it with the rigor.</p>
