  <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I recently remembered reading this article by Dare Obasanjo (<a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/CommentView.aspx?guid=3D5755BF-43CF-4D47-A7EC-B60F6B536702">Functional Programming in C# 3.0: How Map/Reduce/Filter can Rock your World</a>) a long while ago, which was partly a response to Joel Spolsky's article (<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/01.html">Can Your Programming Language Do This</a>).&nbsp; In that article, Dare maps the map/reduce/filter functions to the following Linq equivalents:</p> <ul> <li>map -&gt; Enumerable.Select  <li>reduce -&gt; Enumerable.Aggregate  <li>filter -&gt; Enumerable.Where</li></ul> <p>At the time, I hadn't really had a business need to play with Linq aside from casual curiosity ... all of the projects at work were using other techniques for data access.&nbsp; But more recently, we've been using linq more and more, and I experimented with how a rewrite of a feature might look if it had been written using a functional programming style with LINQ.</p> <p>My experience with that reminded me of something I had read even longer ago, Google's famous MapReduce paper (<a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html">MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters</a>). Now, most of that paper deals with how they distribute the load across a large cluster of computers.&nbsp; But near the very beginning, they have some small examples of the types of problems that could easily be solved by mapreduce, and even a sample pseudocode implementation of one of those programs.</p> <blockquote><pre>map(String key, String value):
    // key: document name
    // value: document contents
    for each word w in value:
        EmitIntermediate(w, "1");<br /><br />reduce(String key, Iterator values):
    // key: a word
    // values: a list of counts
    int result = 0;
    for each v in values:
        result += ParseInt(v);
    Emit(AsString(result));</pre></blockquote>
<p>Note the structure of the various inputs and outputs ... in particular, the output of map (which serves as the input to reduce).&nbsp; It's a key along with an iterator of values that matched that key.&nbsp; That sounds <strong>exactly</strong> like what GroupBy does.&nbsp; Check out the description from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308959.aspx">this article</a>:</p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The standard query operators also include the GroupBy operator, which <strong>imposes a partitioning over a sequence of values based on a key extraction function.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Using linq, I can implement the mapreduce program described above:</p>
<blockquote><pre>var wordOccurrences = words
                .GroupBy(w =&gt; w)
                .Select(intermediate =&gt; new
                {
                    Word = intermediate.Key,
                    Frequency = intermediate.Sum(w =&gt; 1)
                })
                .Where(w =&gt; w.Frequency &gt; 10)
                .OrderBy(w =&gt; w.Frequency);</pre></blockquote>
<p>as you can see ... based on google's definition of MapReduce, I think that Dare was incorrect in asserting that select maps to map (no pun intended), and aggregate maps to reduce.&nbsp; In this example, the GroupBy method is acting as the map, while the Select method does the job of reducing the intermediate results into the final list of results.</p>
<p>The obvious caveat here is that this isn't distributed, it will run locally in memory.&nbsp;&nbsp; But even without the massive scaling that google's mapreduce data center can provide, it can be useful to think of problems in this mindset.&nbsp; And when the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163329.aspx">parallel extensions for linq</a> are finally released, you might even be able to easily take advantage of multiple cores.</p>
