    <p>So unless you’ve been living&#160; under a rock (and/or don’t care about XNA :-P ), you obviously know that v3.1 was announced last week during the GDC.&#160; Not a lot of info has really been put out there as far as specifics go, this seems to be one of the best sources so far:   <br /><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2009/03/24/9506368.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2009/03/24/9506368.aspx</a></p>  <ul>   <ul>     <li>Support for customized Avatars </li>      <li>Support for Xbox LIVE Party features </li>      <li><strong><font color="#ff0000" size="5">Video playback</font></strong> </li>      <li>Updated audio APIs for “fire-and-forget” scenarios </li>      <li>Support for XACT3 </li>      <li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnhar/archive/2009/03/25/automatic-xnb-serialization-in-xna-game-studio-3-1.aspx">Automatic XNB serialization</a></li>      <li>XNA Framework multi-targeting in the Visual Studio 2008 and/or Visual C# 2008 Express Edition IDE </li>      <li>Downloadable content for Xbox LIVE Arcade titles that use XNA Game Studio 3.1 </li>      <li>Consumer notifications when an Xbox LIVE Community Game that they have purchased has been updated</li>   </ul> </ul>  <p>Of course, the video playback feature stood out for me, as it would seem that it will affect the <a href="http://scurvymedia.codeplex.com/">Scurvy.Media</a> project.&#160; I’ve been getting some questions on the matter so I figured I’d just put my current thoughts out there.</p>  <p>Basically, I think it’s great :-) even if it ends up making the library completely obsolete.&#160; I imagine that they will have ways around some of the roadblocks I encountered such as large filesize issues, and texture compression.&#160; Depending on how their feature is factored, there *may* still be a place for Scurvy.Media … for example, I believe I read somewhere on the forums that it will only support WMV (don’t quote me on this, I may have misread or am not remembering right).&#160; But if this is the case, and they’ve factored some level of extensibility into their API, then Scurvy.Media may add support for AVI videos.</p>  <p>In the end, I’m quite happy to see this and the other features coming out … looking forward to giving the beta a shot when it’s announced eventually :-D</p>
