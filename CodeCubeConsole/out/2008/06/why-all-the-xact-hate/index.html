    <p>XNA has been out for a few years now, and I still don't understand why people seem to dislike XACT so much.&nbsp; After I started working on some of the audio for an upcoming presentation, I was reminded just how powerful of a tool it is.&nbsp; I mean, I guess I understand the allure of the super simple audio model offered in XNA 3.0.&nbsp; For simple projects it's definitely a lower barrier to entry.&nbsp; </p> <p>But here's one problem I see with it ... I can almost guarantee that very few people will use XACT once 3.0 is released.&nbsp; Considering that I do not see very much community involvement from the XACT team, or any individuals (where are the xact tutorials, where is the xact team blog?), I fear that an atrophying user-base will kill the project for future releases.</p> <p>Much of the feedback I see about XACT seem to mimic a lot of the negative feedback of the content pipeline.&nbsp; Thankfully, the XNA team hasn't given in and allowed runtime loading of content files.&nbsp; The second they enable that is the second that 99% of people move their projects to import/loading everything at runtime (and thus, introducing longer load times into their games).&nbsp; By limiting that choice, I believe they've done the community a favor because at this point, lots of people are very familiar with building custom content pipeline extensions.</p> <p>so I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you're an XNA developer ... fire up XACT, and give it some love :-)</p> <p><em>ps. I suppose this would be an ironic time to announce that once I upgrade Scurvy.Media to 3.0, I'm going to experiment with automatically importing the video's audio stream using the new SoundEffect/Song APIs :-P</em></p>
