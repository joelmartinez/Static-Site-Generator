    I've mentioned this already to a few close friends, but figured I'd post it here for posterity. I will be giving the presentation at the August <a href="http://www.onetug.org">ONETUG</a> meeting. The topic?
<blockquote>Software development is about constantly learning, and developing your skills. Each new technique, or novel solution to a problem improves your overall effectiveness and value as a software developer/engineer.<br /><br />XNA Game Studio can help you experience those new techniques and solutions by exposing you to a different world of software engineering problems. If you embrace game development as a hobby, you *will* become a better programmer, and this session will show you how.</blockquote>
I've already got the presentation in development ... pretty excited to finally be talking to the locals about some of the stuff that has had so much of my focus for the past year or two :-)
