    <p>I'm happy to announce that the next version of Scurvy.Media has finally been released :-) My original plan to support audio in this release was subsumed by some actual requests for the following features/fixes.&nbsp; It's rather exciting to see the library actually being used for some projects and I hope that these items, along with further feedback will propel the project to greater and greater heights.</p> <h2>Download</h2> <p><a title="https://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=ScurvyMedia&amp;ReleaseId=8615" href="https://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=ScurvyMedia&amp;ReleaseId=8615">https://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=ScurvyMedia&amp;ReleaseId=8615</a></p> <h2>Release Notes</h2> <ul> <li>XBox 360 Project Support!</li> <li>Streaming playback mode is now multithreaded.&nbsp; On xbox, it defaults to Core#2.</li> <li>Texture setting is now double-buffered to avoid <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnhar/archive/2008/04/15/stalls-part-two-beware-of-setdata.aspx" target="_blank">stalls</a>.</li> <li>Internal video related functionality has been moved to the Scurvy.Media.VideoModel namespace to avoid crowding up the root Media namespace.</li> <li>Fixed InvalidOperationException bug.&nbsp; Description <a href="http://codecube.net/?p=28" target="_blank">here</a>. This was a side-effect of the double buffering feature above :-)</li> <li>Improved runtime allocation profile slightly by removing debug write statements (lots of string allocation).</li></ul> <h2>Known Issues</h2> <ul> <li>Using "In Memory" playback type throws an exception. This will be fixed in a follow up release.</li> <li>Using compression partially garbles the texture playback.&nbsp; There is an active thread on the XNA forums about this <a href="http://forums.xna.com/thread/56940.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; Once resolved, the content pipeline will be able to support larger videos, and have a smaller disk footprint of the processed XNB file.</li> <li>Importing a large video will still throw an OutOfMemoryException.&nbsp; I have a bug logged on the <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=323222&amp;SiteID=226" target="_blank">XNA Connect site</a>.&nbsp; However, it has been closed with no hint as to whether it was deferred, or solved.&nbsp; If the compression issue noted above is resolved, it will mitigate this issue.</li></ul>
