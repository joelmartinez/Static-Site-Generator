    <p>Just to give them some googlejuice, I wanted to link to the new programming community site <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow.com</a>. From their vision statement:</p> <blockquote> <p><b>Stackoverflow is sort of like the anti-<a href="http://experts-exchange.com/">experts-exchange</a> (minus the nausea-inducing sleaze and quasi-legal search engine gaming) meets <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/">wikipedia</a> meets <a href="http://programming.reddit.com/">programming reddit</a>.</b> It is by programmers, for programmers, with the ultimate intent of collectively increasing the sum total of <i>good</i> programming knowledge in the world. No matter what programming language you use, or what operating system you call home. Better programming is our goal.</p></blockquote> <p>I have to say that I <strong>love</strong> the idea of someone unseating experts-exchange.&nbsp; I've always hated the fact that these answers show up on google, and they try to trick you into signing up just to see the answer.&nbsp; </p> <p>And I also really like the way that they are changing the way that a community site is structured.&nbsp; I've been a member of many many many an online forum, and I have to say that I'm tired of the same ol' paradigm of the forum.&nbsp; And they also use OpenID! :-P</p> <p>So to them I say, Best of Luck!</p>
