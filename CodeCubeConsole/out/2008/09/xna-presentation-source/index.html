    <p>Apologies for the delay, but I finally got around to packaging up the presentation that I did in my ONETUG presentation in august.&#160; For those who were not in attendance, the entire presentation was written in XNA.&#160; I also ended up using the <a href="http://flatredball.com">FlatRedBall</a> engine to handle a lot of the rendering and collision.</p>  <p>I originally didn't want to make a huge deal about the fact that I was using a third party engine because I wanted the focus of the presentation to be on techniques that you could use with or without an engine instead of specific APIs of that engine.&#160; However, the meeting attendees seemed very receptive and interested in the engine anyways ... which is great because FlatRedBall is a really great engine.&#160; I wholeheartedly suggest checking it out because it makes a great many things so much easier.</p>  <p>Another surprise to me was that there was a lot of interest in the code that ran the actual presentation.&#160; After an impromptu run-through of the code at the end of the presentation, I decided to put a few details for those who were interested (along with the download link below).</p>  <p>I had a great time doing the presentation and I wanted to thank all the good comments that came my way from it.&#160; I would definitely be interested in doing another one that dives into some more detail, particularly 3D concepts which seemed to be a recurring request.</p>  <h3>DOWNLOAD </h3>  <p><a href="http://codecube.net/bloguploads/AugustONETUGXNA.rar">http://codecube.net/bloguploads/AugustONETUGXNA.rar</a></p>  <ul>   <li>Presentation class, handles the main presentation navigation.&#160; Gamepad 1's left and right bumper provided the &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;backwards&quot; navigation.</li>    <li>PresentationScreen class, handles secondary navigation between same-screen indexes.&#160; Also handles the updating of all &quot;IndexActions&quot;.&#160; Gamepad 1's A and B buttons provided the forward/backwards index navigation</li>    <li>IndexAction class, provides a simple mechanism to add custom functionality when a screen index is entered or exited.</li>    <li>*.scnx files, created using FRB's <a href="http://www.flatredball.com/frb/forum/viewtopic.php?t=436">SpriteEditor</a>, each main presentation screen has one .scnx file, which itself defines multiple indexes using a naming convention.</li> </ul>
