Static-Site-Generator

=====================



CLI tool to generate a static site from a Wordpress export file.
 Uses RazorEngine as the templating engine, and a Wordpress post export file as the input.

This is, at least initially, being written primarily to support the move of my blog (http://codecube.net) off of Wordpress. However this tool could be generalized into a more broadly useful tool given time and attention :)
