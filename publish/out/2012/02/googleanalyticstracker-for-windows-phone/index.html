    I've been wanting to add google analytics tracking to the Khan Academy app, but have been putting it off for a while since it looked like the only option was to use the <a href="http://msaf.codeplex.com/">Silverlight Analytics Framework</a>. There's so many things wrong with that distribution:
<ul>
	<li>Overly complex to support <em>N</em> number of different trackers ... enterprise software at it's "best"</li>
	<li>Binary distribution is only via <a href="http://msaf.codeplex.com/releases/view/80753">MSI installer</a>! seriously, in this day and age, either give me a NuGet package, or at worst just give me the .dlls.</li>
	<li>Even though it's open source, <a href="http://msaf.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/85494">looking through the code</a> is an exercise in futility (see point 1). I considered going in and extracting just the code for GA, but it's not even obvious where that is in the codebase ... admittedly, I only browsed around through the online codeplex browser.</li>
</ul>
Thankfully, <a href="http://syndicatex.com/">Justin</a> asked me yesterday about adding GA to his MonoDroid project. I hesitantly pointed him to the MSAF library, but kept searching when I finally came across <a href="http://blog.maartenballiauw.be/">Maarten Balliauw</a>'s sweet implementation of a <a href="https://github.com/maartenba/GoogleAnalyticsTracker">GoogleAnalyticsTracker for asp.net mvc</a>. He was able to quickly adapt the code for his monodroid project; and because GitHub is awesome, I also forked it and added a new project that lets you build the solution for Windows Phone. You can find it here: <a href="https://github.com/maartenba/GoogleAnalyticsTracker">https://github.com/joelmartinez/GoogleAnalyticsTracker</a><br /><br />And then sent back a <a href="https://github.com/maartenba/GoogleAnalyticsTracker/pull/3">pull request</a> for the changes :-) That's the great thing about open source, done GitHub style. I'm free to make (and share) the changes I need ... and if they are good enough, they can easily make their way back into the original/main project. Awesome.<br /><br /><em>Edit: Maarten quickly accepted my pull request, and even adjusted the NuGet package to include the windows 7 build. With that, I deleted my fork as I wasn't planning on making any additional changes in the immediate future. So you can find the latest here: <a href="https://github.com/maartenba/GoogleAnalyticsTracker">https://github.com/maartenba/GoogleAnalyticsTracker</a>
