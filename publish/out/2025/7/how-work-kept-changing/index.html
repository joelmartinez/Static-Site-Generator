    <p>In 2013, I wrote <a href="/2013/09/how-work-is-changing/">a post about how work was changing</a>â€”a snapshot of what felt like the beginning of a broader shift. Remote work was still a bit of a curiosity for many companies but growing, side projects were picking up steam, and the idea of a &quot;swarm economy&quot; was starting to gain traction: people floating between a handful of projects, some paid, some not, on their own time.</p>
<p>Seventeen years later, the shift wasn't just realâ€”it blew past what I expected in many ways; some good, some not.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-changed">So, What Changed?</h2>
<p><strong>Remote work went mainstreamâ€¦ and then got messy.</strong><br />
COVID forced companies to adapt overnight. Video calls, shared docs, and async workflows became the new default. For a while it felt like the promise of freedom had arrived. But then came the reversals: return-to-office mandates, productivity tracking, and the corporate-friendly backlash against &quot;overemployment.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The swarm economy showed upâ€”just not the way I hoped.</strong><br />
Back then, I imagined a future where work flowed naturally across multiple streams: creative, technical, commercial. That happened, but not always with the optimism I projected. For many, the swarm is a patchwork of unstable gigs, stitched together for survival.</p>
<p><strong>AI showed up in a big way.</strong><br />
This is one I didn't predict. In 2013, better collaboration tools felt revolutionary. Today, generative AI sits alongside usâ€”generating text, code, visuals, and even strategy. It's not replacing everyone, but it is reshaping how and where effort matters. This is a very quickly changing landscape.</p>
<p><strong>I underestimated how fast institutional trust would collapse.</strong><br />
The 2022 hiring spree gave way to ruthless layoffs through 2023â€“2025 (and beyond? ðŸ˜”). Teams were cut mid-project. Startups folded despite funding. &quot;Quiet quitting&quot; was followed by corporate retaliation: budget cuts, RTO ultimatums, and performance crackdowns.</p>
<p><strong>The creator and gig platforms plateaued.</strong><br />
In the last post I celebrated platforms like Etsy and VoiceBunny for empowering individuals. That energy grewâ€”Twitch, TikTok, Substack, Patreonâ€”but not all of it was sustainable. Algorithms shifted. Monetization tightened. Creators burned out. Workers pushed back. Some stayed. Some didn't.</p>
<p><strong>The capitalâ€“labor gap widened.</strong><br />
In 2013, I was cautious about how much this &quot;new world&quot; applied beyond tech. That gap is now unmistakable. Asset holders gained. W-2 workers got squeezed. The meritocratic promise of tech now feelsâ€”at bestâ€”complicated.</p>
<h2 id="where-is-it-all-headed">Where Is It All Headed?</h2>
<p>It feels like we're living through a correction. The tools are more powerful than ever. But so is the disillusionment.</p>
<p>If I had to bet, I'd say the next decade brings more fragmentation, more individuals operating in small networks, and more skepticism about top-down structures. Careers will look increasingly nonlinear. Skills will shift from knowing a stack to navigating complex systemsâ€”technical, social, economic.</p>
<p>I'm also starting to believe we'll return to the physical.<br />
We've spent a couple decades obsessed with screens and SaaS. But real resilience might come from reindustrialization: manufacturing, energy, materials, and hardwareâ€”made smarter with software, not replaced by it.</p>
<p>I wrote a bit more about that here:<br />
<a href="/2025/6/domestic-manufacturing/">Domestic Manufacturing and the Road Ahead</a><br />
I'll soon share more thoughts on this, but until then you can keep an eye on: <a href="http://owlprecision.com/">Owl Precision</a>.<br />
More to come!</p>
