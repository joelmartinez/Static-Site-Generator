    <p>There are many different types of productivity, today I’m going to talk about the things that you do on a day to day basis.&#160; A few years ago, I found myself unhappy with my level of productivity and decided to figure out a way to manage my time better.&#160; As one would do when trying to improve the performance of code, I profiled myself.&#160; For a week, I wrote down in painful detail each task I’d do … even if it was just goofing off and browsing the web.&#160; Then at the end of the week I tallied up my results and found that I spent an inordinate amount of time doing the following 3 things.</p>  <ul>   <li>checking email</li>    <li>reading blogs/news</li>    <li>trying to remember things and manage my daily tasks</li> </ul>  <p>I was actually kind of surprised that I was spending so much time doing these non-essential tasks so I started thinking of ways to improve.&#160; I’ve tried a number of techniques over the years, and this is my current setup.</p>  <h3>RSS Reader</h3>  <p>The first thing I wanted to improve was how much time I spent surfing the web.&#160; This was in my mind the thing that contributed the least to my work output (at least I need to read email and manage my tasks to do my job).&#160; Then one day, I discovered the venerable RSS Reader.</p>  <p>My first RSS reader was <a href="http://rssbandit.org/">RSS Bandit</a>.&#160; It’s a desktop client and works pretty well … however, I had issues synchronizing the subscription list between my home PC and work PC (newer versions have solutions for this).&#160; Then google decided to launch <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a> and I haven’t looked back since :-)</p>  <p>I go through every once in a while and clean out feeds that are too chatty, and add new ones that are relevant to my daily workload.&#160; For example, when I started working on an <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/">ASP.NET MVC</a> Project, I added several new feeds like <a href="http://haacked.com/">Phil Haack’s</a> blog.</p>  <p>Nowadays, I’ve got it tuned so that I spend no more than about 5 minutes catching up and reading blogs in the morning.</p>  <h3>Email</h3>  <p>I use <a href="http://gmail.com/">GMail</a> as my email provider and have since the service was in Beta (funny, I know).&#160; Since I use this email address in public forum comments, posts, and to register for websites – I get a considerable amount of extraneous email.&#160; It got to the point where I was checking my account every 5-10 minutes because I got so much mail that I didn’t want to miss the important ones in the noise.</p>  <p>These days, I use gmail’s label and filter system quite extensively.&#160; I identified a few groups of emails that came with great frequency and had some marginal value … enough that I didn’t want to unsubscribe or remove them entirely.&#160; These are things like newsletters from companies that I’ve legitimately done business with, social networking site notifications, and receipts.&#160; So what I’ve done is to create 3 labels:</p>  <ul>   <li>Receipts</li>    <li>Social Networking</li>    <li>Newsletters</li> </ul>  <p>And then created filters that immediately apply the appropriate label to the incoming message and archives it out of my inbox.&#160; That way, I can choose when I want to look over my social network activity instead of having it blast me in the face everytime one of the emails comes in.</p>  <p>The result is that I’m able to focus on core conversations that matter to me.&#160; And when a conversation is done, I can archive it and still feel confident that I can find it using gmail’s search if I ever need to refer back to it. Coupled with GMail’s excellent spam filtering, and I couldn’t really ask for a better email solution.</p>  <h3>TODO List</h3>  <p>Completing the trilogy of productivity is my beloved TODO list.&#160; For years I simply used notepad (whether virtual or physical).&#160; I’d start the day by collecting all of the tasks that I need to accomplish for the day.&#160; As much&#160; detail as I could think of for each task would be logged, and then I just start checking them off one at a time.</p>  <p>That actually works fairly well for me, the only problem is that there is more going on in my life than just my work tasks.&#160; I’d find that multiple things would bump into one another (“take kids to the park when I get home”, “call the insurance company tomorrow at work”, etc.) and purge my brain’s L2 cache, much to my detriment. I was forgetting important things all the time.</p>  <p>Now, I’d heard about the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a></em> system before. As with all self-help advice, I discounted it almost immediately and would never read about it.&#160; However, when <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a> launched I started seriously evaluating how I process the incoming stream of things I need to do.</p>  <p>I came across a few articles that talked about how to apply the GTD system in RTM (which I had recently started using at the time).</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://szafranek.net/blog/2006/08/22/getting_things_done_with_remember_the_milk/">http://szafranek.net/blog/2006/08/22/getting_things_done_with_remember_the_milk/</a></li>    <li><a href="http://blog.rememberthemilk.com/2008/05/guest-post-advanced-gtd-with-remember-the-milk/">http://blog.rememberthemilk.com/2008/05/guest-post-advanced-gtd-with-remember-the-milk/</a></li> </ul>  <p>I must say that it works extremely well for me. I’m able to put things on the list and put my mind at ease that I won’t forget it.&#160; But more importantly, by using the special saved searches to create “Contexts”, stuff that I don’t have to worry about right now is conveniently out of site so it doesn’t clutter up my brain.</p>  <h3>Conclusion</h3>  <p>I’m always looking for ways to improve my workflow and to use technology to help me manage the information overload that this modern age throws at me.&#160; Although this setup is currently working pretty well, I’ve noticed that I constantly have to be adjusting little things about the process (email filters, RTM context queries, RSS subscriptions).</p>  <p>I feel like there’s an impending breakthrough just waiting in the wings that will greatly improve everyone’s workflow … I’ll keep my eye out for it :-)</p>
