    <p>I’ve mentioned to a few people that I recently set my kids up with PCs.&#160; I think back to my first interactions with a computer when I was very young.&#160; My parents bought an Acer IBM Clone from Fingerhut.&#160; I learned so much from using that machine … in an effort to play prince of persia at school, my brother taught me how to make a boot disk to boot the library computer’s into DOS, then launch the game from the command line.&#160; It really taught me a lot about the basics of how the computer works … knowledge that I know has been useful in my career.</p>  <p>So I wanted them to have that same opportunity.&#160; I wanted them to be able to play games, and access learning tools on the internet; but wanted them to do it in as safe an environment as I could manage. So to that end, here’s their setup:</p>  <ul>   <li>Hardware: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Aspire_One">Acer Aspire One</a> netbook</li>    <li>OS: Windows XP</li>    <li>Browser: <a href="http://getfirefox.com">Firefox</a> with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865">AdBlock Plugin</a></li>    <li>Virus Protection: <a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html">Avast Home Edition</a></li>    <li>Parental Control: <a href="http://www.internetsafety.com/safe-eyes-parental-control-software.php">Safe Eyes</a></li>    <li>Whitelist only email: <a href="http://www.zoobuh.com/">Zoobuh</a></li>    <li>Art: <a href="http://getpaint.net">Paint.NET</a></li> </ul>  <p>I did quite a bit of research before running out and getting the kids the netbooks.&#160; Although they were relatively cheap in the grand scheme of things, I didn’t want to spend $600 bucks (for two of them) if it wasn’t going to be safe.&#160; I made sure that their user account was *not* an administrator, and the use of Firefox with adblock gave me a pretty good feeling that they’d be safe from exploits.&#160; </p>  <p>My choice of Safe Eyes was done after reading a lot of reviews.&#160; One of my favorite features was that you could log in and manage the site whitelist from any browser … so if there was some site they needed that was getting blocked, I could just unblock it from work after a phone call from them.&#160; Also, safe eyes can do partial filtering of sites like youtube and google search pages so they can still use the sites, without inadvertently running into content I didn’t want them seeing.</p>  <p>Another little trick I set up was that I made network shortcuts to each other’s laptop and taught them how to move files back and forth.&#160; Unfortunately, this wasn’t very easy … it involved having to manually set some permissions via the command line.&#160; I wish I would have written the steps down so I could share, but alas.&#160; At least they can do some simple file sharing.&#160; I figure that as long as I log on with my admin account periodically and do the windows updates, that they should remain safe.</p>  <p>Of course, I know that nothing is foolproof … we also employ other counter-measures such as making sure to monitor their use.&#160; This ensures that even if there was a way around the parental controls, that there was a physical deterrent, and also it ensured that my investment is secured (ie, they don’t break them).</p>  <p>Wow … It literally *just* occurred to me that both my first computer, and my kid’s first computers were Acers. Go figure :-)</p>
