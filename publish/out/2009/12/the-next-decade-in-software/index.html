    The scientists are already hard at work at <a title="Decades of future science" href="http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/12/22/2159108.aspx">coming up with predictions</a> for the next 10 years. I thought it would be interesting to extract from the list, the predictions that are directly related to software ... along with a few recommendations on how to get started today.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Augmented Reality</strong>
This one is almost already a reality. A number of iPhone apps use the compass, gps, and camera as a viewport to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fZk0HaIs4s">overlay information on top of the world</a>. A few years ago, Johnny Lee posted<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd3-eiid-Uw"> some amazing videos</a> on how to use cheap consumer hardware to meld real and virtual worlds. It is clear that 3D graphics programming will be very helpful in this field ... why not <a title="XNA Creator's Club" href="http://creators.xna.com">start learning now</a>?</li>
	<li><strong>True artificially intelligent computer programs
</strong>This one seems to be the most far fetched. Not because the field is not progressing, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HluWsMlfj68">because it is</a>, but because it's been promised for so long. The biggest problem I think is lack of a clear goal; you can say you want something that learns, but learns what? There needs to be a catalyst that makes it clear what people really want/need from an intelligence. In my opinion, the game industry is <a title="AI Game Dev" href="http://aigamedev.com/">pushing the state of the art</a> here.</li>
	<li><strong>Cell phone apps that will act as a health monitor</strong> <strong>... Sort of an OnStar system for the body</strong>
Since the iPhone proved to everyone that you can have a powerful computer in your pocket, new devices have started appearing that try to <a title="Square" href="https://squareup.com/">piggyback off of the success</a>. I'm looking forward to more people making symbiotic peripherals for phones like the iphone, android based devices, and hopefully WinMo if they ever get their act together.  Mobile programming will surely be a skill to watch in the next decade.</li>
	<li><strong>Cloud computing
</strong>I was a little surprised to see a reference to cloud computing in a science article. But it makes sense when you think about it, because scientists need to make increasingly complex models to prove their theories and solve problems, they will need more and more processing power to do it.<br /><br />I don't think that it will be worth it for the average "you and me" to invest time into learning how to make cloud computing infrastructures. The big 3 (Microsoft, Google, and Amazon) will commoditize these infrastructures and make them easily available ... for a price of course. Learning how to make programs that thrive in the clouds however, will prove to be useful. I've <a href="http://codecube.net/2009/02/mapreduce-in-c-using-linq/">written some</a> about <a href="http://codecube.net/2009/11/qizmt-mapreduce-framework-in-c/">this topic</a> recently. You can start programming in functional languages like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_%28programming_language%29">F#</a>, or learn how to program shaders using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Level_Shader_Language">HLSL</a> to teach your brain how to think in highly parallelizable terms.</li>
</ul>
Time is always the ultimate author of history, so we will have to wait and see how many of these predictions turn out to be true.  But one thing is clear, if you learn how to make games, there is a good chance you will be successful in the next decade ;-)
