    <p>So I've recently become interested in building a multitouch table such as the one seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcKqyn-gUbY">here</a>.&nbsp; All of the techniques for building them involve having a webcam that can see infrared, so I figured that was a first step.</p> <p>The guys over at NUI Group have a great writeup and list of webcams that are easily modifiable for this purpose: <a href="http://wiki.nuigroup.com/Cameras">http://wiki.nuigroup.com/Cameras</a></p> <p>Despite that list, I ended up getting a Microsoft LifeCam VX-5000.&nbsp; The first thing I did to test was put together the simple test rig described here (<a href="http://ssandler.wordpress.com/MTmini/">MT Mini</a>).&nbsp; Very ingenious to simply invert the webcam image so it looks like it's just IR light.&nbsp; That worked really well.</p> <p>So I set about modifying the camera.&nbsp; Since I couldn't really find anything online about modifying this model, I decided to post the steps in case it helps anyone else.&nbsp; Sadly, I neglected to take pictures during the process, so you'll have to rely on my vivid descriptions :-P</p> <ol> <li>Remove the silver ring on the front of the camera.&nbsp; It's stuck on using a small amount of adhesive so you just kind of have to pry it off.</li> <li>Unscrew the two screws keeping the surrounding lens cover and remove it.</li> <li>Unscrew the 3 screws and remove the entire front face.&nbsp; The live messenger button on top will also fall off once you remove it.</li> <li>Unscrew the lens, it had a small amount of some sort of adhesive, which I just had to scratch off with a knife.</li> <li>Remove the screws from the circuit board and remove it from the bottom casing.</li> <li>Unscrew the additional lens housing from the bottom of the board.&nbsp; This is what's covering the IR filter.</li> <li>Once you remove that, you'll have to remove the IR filter (it looks like it reflects redish light).&nbsp; It was glued on so I ended up having to kind of crack the ir filter to remove it piece by piece.</li> <li>Install the IR-Pass filter ... of course, this is where everyone seems to hack it, since lots of guides online tend to suggest using exposed film negative.&nbsp; I cut out two pieces and put them in place of the IR filter.</li> <li>With that done, rebuild everything you've just taken apart until the camera is put back together.</li></ol> <p>I used the TBeta from NUI Group for testing: <a href="http://tbeta.nuigroup.com/">http://tbeta.nuigroup.com/</a></p> <p>And it worked pretty well ... I was able to get a remote control and use it to track the IR LED that lights up when you press a button.&nbsp; The next step will be to start building the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_internal_reflection#Frustrated_total_internal_reflection">FTIR</a> surface.&nbsp; Stay tuned :-P</p>
