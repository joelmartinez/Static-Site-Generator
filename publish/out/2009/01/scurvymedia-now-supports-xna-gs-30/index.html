    <p>well, it was a long time coming ... my apologies to those who were waiting for this :-) but I finally got around to releasing a version of Scurvy.Media that was compiled against XNA 3.0</p> <p>You can find the latest download here: <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ScurvyMedia">http://www.codeplex.com/ScurvyMedia</a></p> <p>There aren't any new features ... the reason this got caught up in the first place is because I was trying to have zune support in before I released it and then I got busy.&nbsp; Oh well, c'est la vie ... I still have to work out the specific surface format and data format that will work on the zune.&nbsp; I think I'm close ... </p> <p>Please let me know if you encounter any issues with this version :-) thanks!</p>
